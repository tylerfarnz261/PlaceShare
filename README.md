Fullstack web application built using the MERN stack. Create an account and share photos of places you've visited and see where your friends have been as well!

Currently only the frontend is up and running and will be updating the README as the app gets more built out. To run, download the repository and use npm (yarn) start to boot the dev server, then check your localhost:3000.
